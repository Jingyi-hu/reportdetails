sampling strategies
===============

Synopsis:
---------

Here are five sampling strategies to simulate the realistic scenarios:

* Random sampling

  * random sampling with specific proportion
  * random sampling with specific number

* Sampling based on the relative position of the building and the collection point

  * north direction
  * south direction
  * west direction
  * east direction

* Sampling by distance
 
  * distance between collected point and centroid of building
  * distance within specific buffer of building's geometry 

* Sampling by time interval
 
  * extract data at specific time intervals

* Sampling by grids
 
  * extract data within different boundaries heights
