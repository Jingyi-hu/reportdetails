GNSS data process
====================

Synopsis:
---------

The raw GNSS data collected by smartphones can not be used directly in this project. In addition to relying on the `gnssmapper <https://gnssmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package developed by the team of Professor Ana from the University of Glasgow to process the data, we also need some other functions to process the data to complete the subsequent sampling work.

Functions:
---------
